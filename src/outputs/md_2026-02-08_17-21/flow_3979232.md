## LLM Analysis
1. Likelihood (0–1):
0.2

2. Main reasons:
*   The communication utilizes the standard HTTPS port (443), suggesting legitimate encrypted web or API traffic.
*   External IP reputation signals indicate no current malicious detections or known fraud associated with the source.
*   Flow duration (60 seconds) and byte count (100 KB+) are typical for a standard, sustained data transfer session (e.g., download).

3. Suspicious feature combination:
High `avg_in_packet_size` (~1212 bytes) sustained over the flow duration (60 seconds), suggesting continuous bulk transfer.

4. Resemblance to known attack behavior:
Insufficient evidence to suggest a known attack pattern.

5. Most informative feature:
L4_SRC_PORT: 443

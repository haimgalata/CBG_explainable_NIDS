## LLM Analysis
1. Likelihood (0–1):
0.2

2. Main reasons:
*   Traffic utilizes standard HTTPS port (TCP 443) originating from a known Content Delivery Network (Cloudflare IP range).
*   Reputation signals for the source IP are neutral (0 malicious detections, no fraud score).
*   Flow characteristics align primarily with a legitimate, high-volume download or streaming session (1.55 MB over 63 seconds).

3. Suspicious feature combination:
The combination of traffic originating on `L4_SRC_PORT=443` (HTTPS) and a highly optimized packet size (`avg_in_packet_size` of 1333.7 bytes) over a large data volume suggests highly efficient bulk data transfer.

4. Resemblance to known attack behavior:
Insufficient evidence to suggest a known attack pattern.

5. Most informative feature:
`avg_in_packet_size` (1333.7 bytes), indicating near-maximum efficiency utilized for data transfer.

## LLM Analysis
1. Likelihood (0–1):
0.3

2. Main reasons:
*   The flow utilizes Protocol 41 (IPv6 encapsulation or 6in4 tunneling), which is highly unusual outside of specific network transition architectures.
*   Zero values for L4 Source and Destination Ports confirm the lack of standard TCP/UDP transport segmentation, consistent with IP-level encapsulation.
*   The flow transferred a large volume (1.8 MB) across 1436 packets over 47 seconds, suggesting significant data exchange within the tunnel.

3. Suspicious feature combination:
Protocol 41 combined with the high `IN_BYTES` and large `avg_in_packet_size`.

4. Resemblance to known attack behavior:
The use of tunneling (Protocol 41) shows weak resemblance to general command-and-control (C2) or data exfiltration techniques, as encapsulation is often used to evade traditional network inspection. Insufficient evidence to suggest a known attack pattern.

5. Most informative feature:
PROTOCOL_NUM: 41

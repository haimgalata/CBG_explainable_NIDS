## LLM Analysis
1. Likelihood (0–1):
   0.6

2. Main reasons:
   - The flow utilizes ICMP (Protocol 1), which is often used for reconnaissance, tunneling, or covert communication channels.
   - The average packet size (1428 bytes) is exceptionally large for standard ICMP traffic, indicating the presence of substantial data payloads.
   - Despite high packet size, external IP reputation signals are currently clean.

3. Suspicious feature combination:
   PROTOCOL_NUM (1), high avg_in_packet_size (1428.0), and IN_BYTES (19992) together suggest ICMP is being used as a data transport mechanism rather than for standard diagnostic functions.

4. Resemblance to known attack behavior:
   Weak resemblance to covert channel activity, specifically ICMP tunneling, used for data exfiltration or Command and Control (C2).

5. Most informative feature:
   avg_in_packet_size (1428.0)
